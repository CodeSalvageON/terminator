Your objective is to fully arm the EMP and destroy all terminators in the building before you run out of rifle ammunition and they get you. Hold off terminators in the hallway by shooting them with your rifle. Be alert for noises and glowing eyes in the hallway. Once you finish the night, the game will redirect you to the home screen, where you can see your TechCom unit's progress by clicking on the first button.
